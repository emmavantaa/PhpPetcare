# Php Petcare
Personal project made for learning PHP. <br>
While working at PHZ Full Stack I noticed they used php on some projects, I decided to look more into it and noticed it was still used in for example Wordpress.
I also wanted to have some kind of project with backend, so Php sounded quite fitting for this. <br> <br>

Previously I had mainly worked with Html/Css and with a pinch of asp.net mvc in C#. <br>

Local backend was created using myphpadmin <br>
